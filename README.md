# Vyzo

Vyzo is an open source, self hosted alternative to note taking tools like Notion and others.
This is still very much in a pre-alpha state, and many things are still yet to become functional

## Setup

1. Setup server from `https://github.com/DDDASHXD/vyzo-server`
2. Clone this repo
3. `npm install`
4. Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and change variables as needed
5. Run frontend

- `npm run dev` for development server
- `npm run build` for building server
- `npm start` to start a production build
